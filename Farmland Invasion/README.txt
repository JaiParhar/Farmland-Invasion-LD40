--The Game--
You play as Dan Danman, a disgruntled farmer attempting to defend his farm from an alien invasion. You must
shoot aliens to protect yourself and your farm. The aliens will drop some weapons and food they have stolen
from other humans, which you can collect. Weapons will give you the weapon and a clip worth of ammo. Food
will give you health back and will increase your max health, but beware, as eating too much food can make
you gain weight and become slower. Luckily, Dan Danman's metabolism is REALLY fast, and he can lose the weight
he gained after just a small distance of walking. However, if you decide to eat more food during the walk, you
will need to walk farther. Now, go defend your farm from those aliens, and most importantly, have fun!
